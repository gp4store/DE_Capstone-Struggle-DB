SQL Client     →  Aurora Serverless → AWS Glue → S3
API
Python Script

1.  Create or deploy an Aurora Serverless service with a Pyscript       ✅
    Notes:
    -   Make data api enable                                            OK
    -   Make it public accesible                                        OK
    -   loading bar while its created cluster or instance               ❌
2.  Check SQL scripts on struggle_db.sql work                           ✅
2.  Connect or load data thru SQL client to Aurora Serverless           ✅
    2.1     Load data thru an API
    2.2     Load data thru Pyscript                                     OK
3.  Transform data using AWS glue configure from Pyscript
    3.1 Decide what data transformations are we going to have
4.  AWS glue job dumping data to S3 
5.  Bucket creation thru Pyscript


SQL Client to Aurora Serverless: Your SQL client connects to Aurora Serverless using standard 
database connections (MySQL or PostgreSQL protocols). Aurora Serverless automatically scales based on demand.
Aurora Serverless to AWS Glue: Glue can connect to Aurora Serverless as a data source using:

JDBC connections for Aurora MySQL or PostgreSQL
Glue crawlers to automatically discover schema
Glue ETL jobs to extract and transform data


AWS Glue to S3: Glue writes processed data to S3 in various formats (Parquet, JSON, CSV, etc.)

Key considerations:

Networking: Ensure proper VPC configuration and security groups allow Glue to access Aurora Serverless
IAM permissions: Glue needs appropriate roles to read from Aurora and write to S3
Connection pooling: Aurora Serverless can pause when inactive, so configure appropriate timeouts
Data formats: Consider using columnar formats like Parquet for better performance in S3
Partitioning: Structure your S3 data with partitions for efficient querying later

this is absolutely considered an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline! Here's how each 
component maps to the ETL process:

Extract:
AWS Glue extracts data from Aurora Serverless (your source database)

Transform:
AWS Glue performs transformations on the data (cleaning, filtering, aggregating, format conversion, etc.)

Load:
AWS Glue loads the processed data into S3 (your destination/data lake)

This is a classic modern ETL pattern commonly used in cloud data architectures. Some additional details:

ETL vs ELT: This is traditional ETL since you're transforming before loading into S3. If you loaded raw 
data to S3 first and then transformed it (using tools like Athena, Spark, or Redshift Spectrum), that would be ELT.
Batch vs Streaming: This setup typically handles batch ETL, though you could make it near real-time using:

Aurora change data capture (CDC)
AWS DMS for continuous replication
Glue streaming jobs

Data warehouse pattern: Your S3 becomes a data lake that can feed into data warehouses like Redshift, or be 
queried directly with Athena.

AWS Glue is specifically designed as a managed ETL service, so you're using it exactly as intended. 
The SQL client → Aurora → Glue → S3 flow is a textbook example of a cloud-native ETL pipeline.

This is an Extended ETL pipeline with multi-stage processing - specifically a Data Lake Analytics Pipeline with Query-Based ETL.
Pipeline Classification:
Hybrid ETL/ELT Pattern: You have both ETL (Glue transformations) and ELT (Athena queries on already-loaded data) components.
Multi-Hop Architecture: Data flows through multiple S3 locations, with each stage serving different purposes.
Detailed Flow:

Extract: Raw data from S3 (Bronze layer)
Transform: Glue processes and cleans data

Crawler discovers schemas → Data Catalog
Glue jobs perform transformations


Load: Processed data to S3 (Silver layer)
Analyze: Athena queries the processed data
Load Again: Query results to S3 (Gold layer)

This Creates a Medallion Architecture:
Bronze Layer (S3 #1): Raw, unprocessed data
Silver Layer (S3 #2): Cleaned, transformed data from Glue
Gold Layer (S3 #3): Aggregated, business-ready data from Athena queries
Key Characteristics:
Data Lineage: Clear progression from raw → processed → analytical datasets
Separation of Concerns: Glue handles complex ETL, Athena handles analytical transformations
Reusability: Silver layer can be queried for different analytical purposes
Scalability: Each stage can be optimized independently
Common Use Cases:

Silver Layer: Standardized, clean data for multiple analytics teams
Gold Layer: Specific business metrics, KPIs, or reports
Incremental Processing: Only reprocess what's needed at each stage

This pattern is excellent for organizations that need both robust data processing (Glue) and flexible analytical 
capabilities (Athena), with clear data quality progression through each layer.
